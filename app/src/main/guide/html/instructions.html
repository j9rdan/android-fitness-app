            <p>Users will first be taken to the sign up page on their first time running the app.

                <br><br>
                <em>we-lift.</em> assumes all non-registered users will want to create a new gym plan, thus
                users are prompted to enter information required to do so.
            </p>
            <p>Users will provide their:</p>

            <h3>Logging in / program creation</h3>
            <p>Once the above data has been submitted, a program will be generated, including the
                muscle a user may have chosen to target. The custom plan will also allocate initial
                weights for each exercise.
            </p>
            <p>After programs are created, users will be taken to the home screen which displays the
                selected split, program type and upcoming workout. The program schedules workouts for the next
                X days after creation, where X is the user's split. For example, if a program is begun today
                on a 4-day split, <em>we-lift.</em> schedules workouts for the next 4 days, alternating between
                muscle groups.

            <h3>Completing a workout</h3>
            <p>Pressing start or the current calendar date will begin today's workout, and once complete,
                users will fill in a difficulty rating for each exercise out of 10, with 10 representing working sets
                that required maximum effort, and 0 representing exercises that were too easy.
            </p>
            <p>These figures are then used to calculate the new volume and adjust the weights for your next exercises.
                Pushing yourself in the gym is required to see any growth, but you cannot push until failure on EVERY SET.
                Hence, the goal is to find a challenging-enough weight that is still safe to use.

            <p>As shown above, each workout is logged on completion of the evaluations and a workout for that same muscle
                group is generated for the same day the following week, using the adjusted volume. The workout count is
                updated in the insights, available for users to monitor their progress. And that's it!

            <h3>Some fitness jargon</h3>
            <p>A lot of words get thrown around when considering the topic of fitness. For clarity, here are a few common terms
                to help ensure anyone and everyone can use <em>we-lift.</em>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Split: distribution of a workout program over a given week</li>
                <li>Hypertrophy: (simple definition) growth in muscle after a stimulus from working out</li>
                <li>Volume: reps x sets x volume</li>
                <li>PPL: common workout split  (Push, Pull, Legs)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Push: targets chest, triceps and shoulders</li>
                    <li>Pull: targets back and biceps</li>
                    <li>Legs: targets all lower body</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Hopefully that clears a few things up. Now you're ready to <em>lift</em>!</p>
